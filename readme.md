# 1. Background
Football (called soccer in the US) is one of the most popular and well-known sports globally. Hence, football match prediction has caught many people's interests, such as betting crowds and companies, researchers, sports teams' management, etc. However, plenty of factors like weather, location, teamsâ€™ lineup, yellow or red cards, home advantage or any other factor could be affected the result of the football match. Therefore, the probability of the result will keep changing within 90 minutes of a football match.
Traditionally, the experts had been predicted the results by different statistical models. One of the most popular statistical models, Markov Chain Monte Carlo [1], attempts to evaluate the game's results by analyzing the strength difference between players, the psychological impact of under-estimate the opponent, calculating the attack intensity, Etc. This mathematical model can reflect a certain extent of the match information. Nevertheless, with the increasing number of football-related information referenced, statistical models are hard to handle a huge amount of data with too many other factors.
Due to the limitation of the statistical models, this research attempted to estimate the abilities of three different machine learning models, SVC, RF and MLP, for predicting football match results which shows a better performance for predicting football matches [2]. The dataset for training the models was acquired by https://www.football-data.co.uk/spainm.php.
A literature review of the previous related work in Section 2. The detail of the dataset description in Section 3. The experiments, exploration data analysis and model evaluation are in Section 4. The comparison of different model and data performances in Section 5.
